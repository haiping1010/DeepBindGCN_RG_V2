# DeepBindGCN_RG_V2

 Our results demonstrate that by integrating Graph Attention Layers (GAT) with the GCN layers, the enhanced model exhibits significantly improved performance on the PDBbind v.2016  core set than the DeepBindGCN_RG_x.
environment:
The environment are same as the DeepBindGCN_RG, which is also same as GraphDTA.

 Usage:
 unzip all the zip file, run the training_nn3_affinity_load.py:
unzip *.zip
